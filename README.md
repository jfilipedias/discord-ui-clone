This project is a Discord UI clone developed with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to learn more about front end development. 

The main objectives of the project were to learn more about react projects structure, components segregation and UI styling. Grid layout was used to organize the UI components, and the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [styled-icons](https://styled-icons.dev/) library to create the components styles.
